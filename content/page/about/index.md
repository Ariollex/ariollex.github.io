My name is Artem Agapkin, who is called Ariollex on the Internet. I am working on some projects like android rom. I am using Windows 11 / Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (dual boot) on ASUS VivoBook S15 M533IA.

I prefer Python for programming, but I'm also learning other languages.

I am available on Telegram almost all the time, except for sleep. You can write to me in telegram (Please don't write a stupid “hi” and don't expect me to answer it. Write your question or request right away). You can also email me ariollex@gmail.com.
